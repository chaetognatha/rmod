#README FOR RMOD
This script contains a number of functions that are helpful for working with statistical tests, additionally the script will clear out objects that are stored in memory when run.
A number of libraries are loaded to declutter data processing scripts.
There is a settings section which determines color palette for some functions and modifies the display of plots, this is probably most convenient when working on a big screen,
high resolution desktop.
